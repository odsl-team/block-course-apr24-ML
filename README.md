## Exercises: 

Starter code for the hands-on portion.

**Session 1:**
- `Bias-Variance-Tradeoff.ipynb`
- Bonus: `FurtherReadingDay1.ipynb`: an interesting phenomenon called "double descent" that is touched on in the Day 3 lecture "Tips and Tricks for training NNs", that we can already see evinced in our linear model example

**Session 2 + 3:** Neural Networks and Automatic Differentiation
- `Our-first-NN.ipynb`

**Session 4:** Pytorch
- `Intro-to-Pytorch.ipynb`

**Session 5:** Tips and Tricks for training NNs
- `Going-Deeper.ipynb`

**Session 6:** Unsupervised Learning
- `PCA.ipynb`

## Teaching-nbs:

Some notebooks that generated a few of the example plots for the class lectures.

- Bias vasriance trade off: `Linear-fits.ipynb`
- Classification: `Sigmoid.ipynb`
- SGD and Momentum optimizer: ``
- K-means: `Unsupervised-Learning.ipynb`
- PCA motivating examples: `PCA-1d.ipynb`
